# Quote of the Day Web App

## Overview
The "Quote of the Day" web app is a simple, elegant, and user-friendly application designed to inspire and motivate users by providing them with a daily dose of wisdom. Every time the page is loaded, a new quote from a diverse range of authors is fetched and displayed, offering users a fresh perspective and insight.

## Features
- **Minimalistic Design**: A clean and distraction-free interface ensures the quote remains the focal point.
- **Dynamic Content**: Utilizes the Quotable API to fetch a random quote every time the page is visited.
- **Responsive**: Designed to be viewed on devices of all sizes, from desktops to mobile phones.

## How It Works
The application is built using basic web technologies:
- **HTML** for structuring the content.
- **CSS** for styling and creating a visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript** for fetching the quote from the API and updating the DOM.

Upon loading the webpage, a JavaScript function makes a request to the Quotable API. Once the quote data is received, it's displayed on the page, presenting the quote's content and its author.

## Getting Started
To view the "Quote of the Day" app, simply clone the repository, and open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser. No additional setup or configuration is required.
